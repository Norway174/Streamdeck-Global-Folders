# Streamdeck Global Folders

More or less a proof of concept and working prototype of how something like this could function.

Basically, it comes bundled with some premade empty profiles.

So you can fill them up with whatever you want. Despite the name "Folder", this is using Profiles.
But the "Exit Global Folder" will only work inside of these profiles, and it will take you back to your last selected profile.


This let's you add two profiles for different applications. Then pick one of them available global profiles, build your folder. Such as, a Discord or music control panel.

Then from both application profiles, you can select the same folder. And they will both open the same profile. And when you exit the profile, it'll take you back to your last selected application.

This project came to be from this Reddit thread from 3 years ago. And big thanks for Reddit user KSP_HarvesteR for the inspiration behind this.



Known issues:
* If you add multiple pages to the global folder, and navigate between them, the "Exit Global Folder" will no longer function. (Probably won't be able to fix?)
 But with multple pages, it will remember the last page you were on. And you could add an Exit button to each page.

* Same with folders. However, folders will not re-open where you last were.
